MRM ODD Autofill Demo - Screen Recording Script
=================================================

Total duration target: ~90 seconds


SCENE 1 — THE PROBLEM  (0:00 - 0:15)
--------------------------------------

[Screen: Word document open, showing the empty ODD form.
         Scroll slowly through the form so all empty fields are visible.]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "MRM analysts spend hours manually filling Object Development Documents."

NARRATION:
  "This is a typical ODD — an Object Development Document for Model Risk
  Management. Every field is empty. Filling this manually means switching
  between the form and multiple source documents, copying values one by one."


SCENE 2 — THE CONTEXT FILE  (0:15 - 0:25)
-------------------------------------------

[Screen: Open File Explorer, show model_info.txt next to the .docm file
         in the same folder. Briefly open model_info.txt in Notepad.]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "Reference data sits in a simple text file — right next to the form."

NARRATION:
  "All the model information lives in a plain text file in the same folder.
  No special setup needed — just drop the file next to the document."


SCENE 3 — ONE CLICK  (0:25 - 0:35)
------------------------------------

[Screen: Back in Word. Click the "Fill Form" button on the Quick Access
         Toolbar (or run Alt+F8 → FillForm_Tracked_ByPython).]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "One click: the macro detects all form fields and sends them to the AI."

NARRATION:
  "One click. The macro scans the document, detects every field type —
  content controls, placeholders, blanks, checkboxes — packages them
  with the document context, and sends everything to the AI server."


SCENE 4 — FIELDS FILLED  (0:35 - 0:55)
-----------------------------------------

[Screen: Form is now filled. Scroll through slowly.
         Show: "CCAR Loss Forecasting Model" in Model Name,
               "MRM-2025-0042" in Model ID,
               "Tier 1 - Critical" selected in dropdown,
               placeholders replaced in Section 2,
               underscore blanks filled in Section 3,
               checkboxes checked in Section 4.
         Show Track Changes marks (red underlines/strikethroughs).
         Hover over a "Reason:" comment to show the AI's explanation.]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "Every field filled. Every change tracked. Every value explained."

NARRATION:
  "Every field is filled with the correct value from the reference file.
  All changes are tracked — nothing is silently overwritten.
  And each field has a comment explaining why that value was chosen.
  The analyst can accept or reject any individual change."


SCENE 5 — ADD A COMMENT TO FIX TEXT  (0:55 - 1:05)
----------------------------------------------------

[Screen: Scroll to Section 5 "Executive Summary".
         Highlight the paragraph (which has grammar errors).
         Right-click → New Comment.
         Type: "fix grammar and make more professional"
         Click the Fill Form button again (or Alt+F8).]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "Need a fix? Just leave a comment and click the button again."

NARRATION:
  "The executive summary has some grammar issues. The analyst simply
  highlights the text, adds a comment with the instruction — 'fix
  grammar and make more professional' — and clicks the button again."


SCENE 6 — TEXT FIXED  (1:05 - 1:25)
-------------------------------------

[Screen: Show the revised paragraph — grammar corrected, more formal tone.
         Show the tracked change (old text struck through, new text inserted).
         Show the new comment: "Applied fix. Reason: ...".]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "Text revised as a tracked change — fully auditable."

NARRATION:
  "The AI rewrites the paragraph as a tracked change. The original text
  is preserved in the revision history. The analyst reviews, accepts, done.
  Full audit trail from start to finish."


SCENE 7 — CLOSING  (1:25 - 1:30)
----------------------------------

[Screen: Final view of the completed document with Track Changes visible.]

ON-SCREEN TEXT (caption):
  "Forminator — AI form filling for Word.
  Detect fields. Load context. Fill. Fix. All tracked."

NARRATION (optional):
  "Forminator: detect the fields, load the context, fill the form, fix
  the text — all in tracked changes. Minutes of manual work, done in seconds."


===================================================================
NOTES FOR RECORDING
===================================================================

- Use a clean Word window, zoom ~130% so fields are clearly readable
- Turn on Track Changes before recording (the macro does this too)
- Use the Review pane or hover over comments to show AI explanations
- Keep mouse movements slow and deliberate for clarity
- If using demo mode (no LLM key), the fills will be placeholder values —
  for a realistic recording, set LLM_API_KEY to get real AI fills
- The Python server must be running: uvicorn python_form_filler:app --port 8000
